# 320 and Up based Wordpress Theme

This starter theme is heavily based on [320 and Up](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/) for most of the front-end and the [Bones Theme](http://themble.com/bones/) for many of the great function helpers. I've added other basics like Susy Grids for building a custom grid depending on the project. 

I started putting this theme together because I like the ease of prototyping with frameworks like Foundation or Bootstrap but I would rather add needs than strip them out. I also want to build mobile-first as much as possible and at this time these popular frameworks are both desktop-first.
